# 📱 Mobile Screen Time Tracker

This repository is a personal accountability log where I track my **daily mobile screen time**.  
The goal is to build **digital discipline**, reduce distractions, and stay focused on my long-term goals.

## ❓ Why I Am Doing This

Because I saw I keep hopping between one social media platform to another without any intention whenever I have free time. This leads to my mind becoming more **unstable and distracted** over time, and eventually, it may **lose the ability to resist bigger unnecessary cravings**. This log is my way to bring back conscious control.

## 🎯 Goal

I want **more mindful control** over my life and aim to reduce mobile usage to just **30 minutes daily (in best cases)**.  
All intentional work like **studying, learning, and using LinkedIn** will be done on my **laptop**, not mobile.

## 🛑 Exception

I will add a note whenever I have to take an **exception** due to any reason — but it must be a **real and valid one**.  
**Cravings or boredom won't count** as valid reasons.

## 🗓️ How I Track

- I upload a **daily screenshot** of my mobile screen time in the respective monthly folder.
- I include brief reflections in `daily-log.md`.
